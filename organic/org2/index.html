<p>Some of the techniques and practices integral to organic farming are listed below. This list is not complete in itself, and farmers can innovate and adapt to suit their surroundings. That is what organic farming is : the answers to a problem should come from the farmer, his fields and his surroundings rather than from a chemical factory or the village pesticide shop. Moreover, there cannot be a fixed package of practices – every area is unique in its own way, has its own endemic species – both plant and animal – and its own natural conditions. While training and advising farms and farmers, we too bear in mind these requirements of organic farming.</p><br>


<p>Please note that this section is only a starting point and covers the basic principles and techniques. It is not exactly a how-to section, but more of an introduction for the intending organic farmer and an overview of techniques, including specialised forms of organic farming.</p><br>
