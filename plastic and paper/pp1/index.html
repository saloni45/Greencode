       <h2> Introduction To Paper Recycling</h2>
      <p>Recycling has become a popular industry in the United States due to a growing interest in saving the planet. Paper recycling makes up a large segment of the industry and is defined as the range of activities associated with the recovery and processing of scrap paper so that it can be used in the production of new paper products.  </p>

      <h2>Recyclable and Non-Recyclable Paper</h2>
<p>Nearly all kinds of paper are recyclable. Paper items that are not typically acceptable in collection bins include brown and craft envelopes, carbon paper, paper towels, tissues, candy wrappers, coffee cups, and pizza boxes. Some of the most commonly recycled paper items include cardboard, newsprint and magazines, manuals and booklets, and office paper.</p>
<h3>In the United States, paper-making materials come from three primary sources:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Recycled paper: 33%</li>
<li>Whole trees and other plants: 33%</li>
<li>Wood chips and scraps from sawmills: 33%</li>
</ul>
<h2>First Phase of Paper Recycling Process</h2>
<p>The paper recycling process involves several steps that begin with the collection, transportation, and sorting:
</p>
<ul id ="wrapper">
<li>
<strong>Collection:</strong></li>Waste papers are collected from collection bins and deposited in a large recycling container along with the paper received from other collection bins.
<li><strong>Transportation:</strong></li> All of the recovered or collected paper waste then gets transported to the paper recycling plant on a collection van or truck.
<li><strong>Sorting</strong>.</li> After getting transported to the recycling plant, the papers are sorted into different paper categories, such as cardboard, newspapers, newsprint, magazine paper, and computer paper.
</ul>
<p>Manufacturing recycled copy paper saves 100% of the trees, 31% of the energy and 53% of the water, and produces 39% less solid waste.</p>
<h2>Main Phase of the Paper Recycling Process</h2>
<p>Once the paper is sorted, it is processed into usable raw materials. This phase involves multiple functions that include:</p>
<p>Making pulp or slurry: Pulping involves water and chemicals. To pulp the paper, machines first chop it before water and chemicals are added. The mixture is then heated to break down the paper into paper fibers. Finally, the mixture turns into a mushy mix, known as a slurry or pulp.
Pulp screening and cleaning: To remove contamination from the pulp, the pulp is forced through screens with holes of different sizes and shapes to remove contaminants such as globs of glue and bits of plastic. If the pulp still contains any heavy contaminants like staples, the pulp may be spun around in huge cone-shaped cylinders. The cylinders throw the heavy contaminants out of the cone using centripetal force, while light contaminants move to the center of the cone and are removed.</p>

<p>De-inking: Next begins the removal of ink from the paper fibers of the pulp, while sticky materials, known as &ldquo;stickies&rdquo;&sbquo;are also separated. De-inking is done through a combination of mechanical actions like shredding and the addition of chemicals. Light and small ink particles are removed using water, while heavier and larger particles are removed using air bubbles in a process called flotation.
Refining, color stripping, and bleaching: In the refining stage, the pulp is beaten to make the paper fibers swell. Beating the pulp also separates individual fibers to facilitate new paper production from the separated fibers. If coloring is required, color stripping chemicals are added to the fibers to remove the dyes from the paper. When the goal is to produce white recycled paper, the pulp is bleached with oxygen, chlorine dioxide, or hydrogen peroxide to make them brighter or whiter.</p>

<h2>Final Phase of the Paper Recycling Process</h2>
<p>In the final stage of the paper recycling process, the cleaned paper pulp is then ready to be used in the production of new paper. Normally, the pulp is blended with virgin wood fibers to provide the new paper with added smoothness and strength. However, the recycled paper fibers can also be used alone. At this stage, the paper pulp is mixed with chemicals and hot water. The percentage of hot water in the mixture is far greater than that of paper fibers and chemicals. </p>

<p>The mixture is fed into the headbox of a papermaking machine and sprayed in a continuous jet onto a large wire mesh-like screen moving very fast through the machine. As the water from the mixture starts to drain, the recycled paper fibers begin to bond to form a watery sheet. The sheet moves quickly through a series of felt-cover press-rollers that squeeze out more water resulting in a freshly manufactured sheet of paper.</p>
<h2>Current Trends in Paper Recycling</h2>
<p>The paper recycling rate continues to improve, although the industry has been negatively impacted by depressed global prices and challenges associated with contamination during the curbside recycling process. One positive development has been an increase in curbside OCC generation, which is attributed to the growth of e-commerce and home delivery. Paper is increasingly used more for packaging and less for communication, resulting in an evolving mix of material being generated.</p>
