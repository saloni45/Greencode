  <P>Recycling of paper and plastics begins in the home, and ends with recycled materials being recovered to make into new products. Learn about the processes and technologies that happen in between, and check out profiles of several companies in this sector</P>


    <h2><strong>Can You Recycle Paper And Platic Together:</strong></h2>
  <p>Together, paper and plastic make up 40 percent of the garbage discarded by the average American. Thankfully, both paper and plastic are easily recycled; both materials can be made into new products instead of sitting in a landfill. Many cities and towns in the U.S. practice curbside recycling, in which you sort your recyclables into a separate bin and they're picked up along with your garbage. Even if you do not live in an area that offers this service, you can participate by transporting your recyclables to the nearest central recycling facility.</p>
  <h2><strong>Environmental Recycling</strong></h2>
  <p>It conserves energy, reduces air and water pollution, reduces greenhouse gases, and conserves natural resources.</p>

<p>Stanford recycled, composted, and otherwise source reduced 62% of its waste and reduced landfill by 35%.  The results are cleaner air and water, less pollution, more forested land and open space, and reduced greenhouse gases.</p>

<p>Everyone knows recycling means less trash going to our landfills but the greatest environmental benefit of recycling is the conservation of energy and natural resources and the prevention of pollution that is generated when a raw material is used to make a new product.</p>
<h2><strong>Why Recycling Is Important</strong></h2>
<p>
A: With the involvement and enthusiasm of people like you, recycling is back and so are thousands upon thousands of recycled products made from materials that would otherwise be piling up in our nation's landfills.  It makes a huge difference to our environment, our quality of life, and our country's future.</p>

<p>Why It's Important:-</p>

<p>As stewards of the environment, we are responsible for preserving and protecting our resources for ourselves and for future generations.</p>

<p>Getting Back To Basics:-</p>

<p>Recycling is really just common sense, and until the "modern era," it was a common household activity. Before the 1920s, 70% of U.S. cities ran programs to recycle certain materials. During World War II, industry recycled and reused about 25% of the waste stream. Because of concern for the environment, recycling is again on the upswing. The nation's composting and recycling rate rose from 7.7% of the waste stream in 1960 to 17% in 1990. It's currently up to around 30%. California is at about 48%.</p>

<p>The Garbage Crisis:-</p>

<p>The world has changed a lot in the past century. From individually packaged food servings to disposable diapers, more garbage is generated now than ever before. The average American discards seven and a half pounds of garbage every day. This garbage, the solid waste stream, goes mostly to landfills, where it's compacted and buried. As the waste stream continues to grow, so will the pressures on our landfills, our resources, and our environment.</p>

<p>Recycling - An Important Part Of The Solution:-</p>

<p>The more we recycle, the less garbage winds up in our landfills and incineration plants. By reusing aluminum, paper, glass, plastics, and other materials, we can save production and energy costs, and reduce the negative impacts that the extraction and processing of virgin materials has on the environment.</p>

<p>It all comes back to you. Recycling gets down to one person taking action. New products can be made from your recyclable waste material. Recycling is good for our environment, our communities, and our economy.
