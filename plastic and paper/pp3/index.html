      <p>Plastic recycling refers to the process of recovering waste or scrap plastic and reprocessing the materials into functional and useful products. This activity is known as the plastic recycling process. The goal of recycling plastic is to reduce high rates of plastic pollution while putting less pressure on virgin materials to produce brand new plastic products. This approach helps to conserve resources and diverts plastics from landfills or unintended destinations such as oceans.</p>  


<h2><strong>The Need for Recycling Plastic</strong></h2>
<p>Plastics are durable, lightweight and inexpensive materials. They can readily be molded into various products which find uses in a plethora of applications. Every year, more than 100 million tons of plastics are manufactured across the globe. Around 200 billion pounds of new plastic material is thermoformed, foamed, laminated and extruded into millions of packages and products. Consequently, the reuse, recovery and the recycling of plastics are extremely important. </p> 


<h2>What Plastics Are Recyclable?</h2>
<p>There are six common types of plastics. Following are some typical products you will find for each of plastic:</p>

<ul>
<li id="wrapper"><strong>PS (Polystyrene) <span>&#8208;</span></li></strong> <p>Example: foam hot drink cups, plastic cutlery, containers, and yogurt.</p>

<li id="wrapper"><strong>PP (Polypropylene) <span>&#8208;</span></li></strong><p>Example: lunch boxes, take-out food containers, ice cream containers.</p>

<li id="wrapper"><strong>LDPE (Low-density polyethylene)<span>&#8208;</span></strong> <p>Example: garbage bins and bags.</p>

<li id="wrapper"><strong>PVC (Plasticised Polyvinyl chloride or polyvinyl chloride)<span>&#8208;</span></strong><p>Example: cordial, juice or squeeze bottles.</p>

<li id="wrapper"><strong>HDPE (High-density polyethylene)<span>&#8208;</span></li> </strong><p>Example: shampoo containers or milk bottles.</p>

<li id="wrapper"><strong>PET (Polyethylene terephthalate) <span>&#8208;</span></li></strong><p>Example: fruit juice and soft drink bottles.

<p>Currently, only PET, HDPE, and PVC plastic products are recycled under curbside recycling programs. PS, PP, and LDPE typically are not recycled because these plastic materials get stuck in the sorting equipment in recycling facilities causing it to break or stop. Lids and bottle tops cannot be recycled as well. &ldquo;To recycle or Not to Recycle&rdquo; is a big question when it comes to plastic recycling. Some plastic types are not recycled because they are not economically feasible to do so.</p>

<h3>Some Quick Plastic Recycling Facts</h3>
<ul id="head">
<li>Every hour, Americans use 2.5 million plastic bottles, most of which are thrown away.</li>
<li>About 9.1% of plastic production was recycled in the U.S. during 2015, varying by product category. Plastic packaging was recycled at 14.6%, plastic durable goods at 6.6%, and other non-durable goods at 2.2%.</li> 
<li>Currently, 25 percent of plastic waste is recycled in Europe.</li>
<li>Americans recycled 3.14 million tons of plastics in 2015, down from 3.17 million in 2014.</li>
<li>Recycling plastic takes 88% less energy than producing plastics from new raw materials.</li>

<li>Currently, around 50% of plastics we use are thrown away just after a single use.</li>
<li>Plastics account for 10% of total global waste generation.</li>
<li>Plastics can take hundreds of years to degrade</li>
<li>The plastics that end up in the oceans break down into small pieces and every year around 100,000 marine mammals and one million seabirds get killed eating those small pieces of plastics.</li>
<li>The energy saved from recycling just a single plastic bottle can power a 100 watt light bulb for nearly an hour.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Plastic Recycling Process</h2>
<p>The simplest of plastic recycling processes involves collecting, sorting, shredding, washing, melting, and pelletizing. The actual particular processes vary based on plastic resin or type of plastic product.</p>
<br>
<p>Most plastic recycling facilities use the following two-step process:</p>
<ul id="head">
<li id="wrapper" ><strong>Step One:</li></strong><div id="head2"><p> Sorting plastics automatically or with a manual sort to make sure all the contaminants are removed from the plastic waste stream. </p>

<li id="wrapper"><strong>Step Two: </li></strong><p>Melting down plastics directly into a new shape or shredding into flakes then melting down before being finally processed into granulates.</p></ul>
